    <p>Hello, my name is Aryan Dwaram. Here is my website to tell you a little bit about myself and my future goals. I have a few goals for  myself in high school and college. I want to get on my high school varsity volleyball team and be a starter. I also want to get into one of the UCs in California. I want to play volleyball in high school and since this is a new school my chances for starting on a varsity team are much higher.I also want to go to college nearby because I want to stay close to my parents and also the schools here are really good. After high school I want to join a tech company and work there for most of my life. This has been the same for a few years. I want a stable life that's simple and provides me time to enjoy my hobbies.<p>
    <p>I learned very early on how to be cooperative through the sports I played when I was young. Playing sports early on also taught me how to be a team player, and improved my social skills. I learned early on how to interact with others and patience when others had conflicting ideas. These skills carried throughout my life and still continue to help me today.<p>
    <p>Currently I have just started High School and am a freshman in Emerald High. I am currently taking two advanced courses(Honors Chemistry and Adv. Algebra II). I skipped the normal courses over summer for chemistry and 2 math courses because I did well on the test for the math course the year before I was supposed to take it. I was part of a club volleyball team and went to Anaheim recently for the final tournament of the season. Something I learned while taking advanced courses was that they are not easy. But even if they arenâ€™t easy as long as I put in the effort needed I can do well in them.
